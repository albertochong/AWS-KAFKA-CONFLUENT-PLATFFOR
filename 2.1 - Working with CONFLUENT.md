## Reference KAFKA commands 
###  

## Run in Terminal

* Show topics parameters.Go to <KAFKA_HOME> folder
```bash
 bin/kafka-topics.sh
```

* Create topic with 3 partitions and replication tp 2 brokers.Go to <KAFKA_HOME> folder
```bash
 bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 2 --partitions 3 --topic TopicTest
```
```bash
 Topic created with 3 partitions in broker1 
 ```

* Describe one topic.Go to <KAFKA_HOME> folder
```bash
 bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic TopicTest
```

```bash
 What we have:
 1 - Topic : Topic Name
 2 - PartitionCount  : numbers of partitions
 3 - ReplicationFactor : number of brokers
 4 - Replicas : replicas in broker 0 and 1
 5 - Leader : is the main broker id where the messages from producer are stored first,
     is responsible for all reads and writes for the given partition
 6 - Isr : is the sequence of broker id how message are stored, are in-sync replicas
 OBS: if one broker is doww another broker take position, this is fault tolerance
```

* Creating messages with producer.Go to <KAFKA_HOME> folder
```bash
bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list ec2-3-17-3-207.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9092,ec2-3-17-3-207.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9093 --topic TopicTest
```
* Consumer messages with consumer console.Go to <KAFKA_HOME> folder
```bash
bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server ec2-3-17-3-207.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9092,ec2-3-17-3-207.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9093 --topic TopicTest --from-beginning
```
